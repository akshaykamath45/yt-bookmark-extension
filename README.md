# YT bookmark extension

Allows users to bookmark specific timestamps in YouTube videos while they are playing. Users can click a bookmark button in the extension to save the current timestamp. When they later click on a saved timestamp in the extension, it opens the YouTube tab and navigates to the exact timestamp,
automatically playing the video from that point.
